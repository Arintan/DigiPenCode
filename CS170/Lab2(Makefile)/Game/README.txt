To use the makefiles, you'll need to create 2 directories inside
the Game directory named:

  gnu
  ms

Then run the 'build.bat' file and it should build both projects
in the corresponding directory, provided that both compilers are 
setup and in the path correctly. You can run 'build-run.bat' and
that will build and run the game using the provided input file.
