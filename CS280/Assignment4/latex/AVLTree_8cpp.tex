Specific portions that gave you the most trouble\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item using templates here gave me a lot of trouble, not sure why. I had some trouble getting to use functions and data inherited from \hyperlink{classBSTree}{B\-S\-Tree}.
\item deleting nodes was troublesome took me awhile to get all cases correct, even with pseudocode posted on the site.
\item stree test will fail. At some point along the way pointers were being dropped. I implemented example from website to make sure I was handling multiple rotations in one deletion and it was correct. I just couldnt figure out where things went wrong.
\item also I couldnt replicate the input for the stresstest. I got a different set of data to insert/remove. Any other tests that use P\-R\-N\-G functions give me the same input as the website but for some reason it doenst for the stress test. I ran on both my laptop (mac os x) and linux and got the same input for both systems. (they were the same but still wrong).tree\-\_\-
